# Data Science: User Churn Prediction (Churn Analyst)
Churn Analyst is an analyzing tool to predict the churn score for telecommunication companies based on user pattern and analyze the most important factors that influence customer churn
•	Applied supervised learning models (logistic regression and random forest) to predict the probability of a specific customer will stop current service

•	Used feature selection methods (Pearson Correlation, PCA, Regularization, Information Entropy/Gini impurity-based Feature Importance calculation) to reduce overfitting and to analyze top features that influence user churn score

•	Implemented the machine learning pipeline using Apache Spark ML-lib

# Data Science: Document Clustering (Topic Classifier)
Topic Classifier is used to analyze the underlying structure of documents automatically and visualize the clustering result using natural language processing models/tools

•	Applied text preprocessing by tokenizing (via Apache openNLP) and stemming

•	Used Natural Language Processing methods (TF-IDF, N-grams) to analyze the words-to-documents importance in a text corpus

•	Trained the model using different unsupervised learning algorithms (K-means, Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
